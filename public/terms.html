    <h2>Billing & Payments</h2>
    <p>Billing is handled through Stripe, our third-party payment processor. Subscriptions are billed monthly on the anniversary of your subscription date. You may cancel your subscription at any time; your access will continue until the end of your current billing period. We do not offer refunds for partial months of service.

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL TEXTKIT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO TEXTKIT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>
